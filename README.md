_**MAPTY APP**_

**Overview**:
Mapty app is a web application designed to help users maintain records of their workouts, such as running and cycling, at different locations. The application features a side panel where users can input details about their workouts and a map that displays the locations and dates of these workouts. This project leverages JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create an interactive and user-friendly experience.

**Features**:

   1. Workout Input Panel: A side panel that allows users to input details about their workouts, including type (running, cycling), duration, distance, and location.

   2. Interactive Map: A map that displays the locations of all recorded workouts. Each workout is marked with a pin that shows the date and details when clicked.

   3. Date and Location Tracking: Automatically records the date and location of each workout, providing a visual history of workout activities.

   4. Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes OOP principles to create a modular and maintainable codebase.


**Usage :**

Upon opening the application, you will see a map and a side panel.

1. Use the side panel to input the details of your workout:
      a) Select the type of workout (running, cycling).
      b) Enter the required details about the workout.
   
2. The map will automatically update with a marker at the location of your workout.
   
3. Click on a marker to view the details of the workout.


**Technologies Used:**

1. JavaScript: The primary programming language used for the application logic.

2. Leaflet.js: A JavaScript library used for interactive maps.

3. HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the application interface.
